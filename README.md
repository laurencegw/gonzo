# Me

**STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

A personal web site.

Written with:

    * Spring-Boot
    * Kotlin
    * Angular
    * Bootstrap
    * Gradle
    
## The plan

1) Write the site with blogging, social media and administration features.
2) Deploy on something free.
3) Template it so that it is reusable.
4) Write a cookie cutter app for the template. So that it is more easily reusable.
