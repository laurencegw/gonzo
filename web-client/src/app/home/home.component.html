      Have you ever come across a pull request or code review where the developer has put together a mini framework that
      might be tending towards over engineering? Or maybe there is a new utility for performing a task that you know
      there is a perfectly good library for?
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe it is you who does this and submits the pull request?
    </p>
    <p>
      The feedback given/received is most likely some paraphrasing of the well known wisdom; "Do not reinvent the wheel!"

      Well, if the person submitting those PR's is you, and you are itching to try and solve problems that other people
      have probably solved a thousand times already, and probably a thousand times better than you could solve it
      anyway, then you have come to the right place my friend. Gonzo Code is here for you.
